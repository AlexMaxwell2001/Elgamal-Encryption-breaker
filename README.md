# Elgamal-Encryption-breaker
This is a java example of a way to Break Elgamal's Encryption.
This program takes in the public key of the sender of the message all seperated by a single space e.g (150001, 7, 66436).
Then on a new line the program accepts the sender's cipher sent to the reciever seperated by a single space e.g (90429, 57422).
The message being sent between the two people can then be deciphered by brute force.
